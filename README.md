# Vogue Lifestyle

This is a demo project to get started with learning Next.js / React.
It fetches the latest articles from https://www.vogue.de/lifestyle and displays them on the home page.
The home page is statically generated and revalidated every 60 seconds (Incremental Static Generation).
Styling is done via Tailwind CSS.
A live deployment is available at https://vogue-lifestyle.vercel.app.
